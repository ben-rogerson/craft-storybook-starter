# Craft Storybook Starter

[Storybook](https://storybook.js.org/) is an open source tool for developing UI components in isolation.<br>
It makes building stunning UIs organized and efficient.

üéâ Storybook runs outside Craft in JavaScript and doesn't require a Craft plugin<br>
üéâ Storybook works with the same Twig files from your project [with some differences](#user-content-hosting-your-storybook)

This starter sets up everything for you to be productive in Storybook.<br>Use Storybook to create a living styleguide from of your existing site/app.<br>
Take advantage of the excellent Webpack dev server to create solid components with mock data.

## Storybook Features

This starter has many modern features including:

üëç Hot module reloading<br>
üëç Automatic accessibility tests<br>
üëç Color accessibility tests<br>

## Getting Started

### Create a new project

Create a new project based on this template using [degit](https://github.com/Rich-Harris/degit):<br>
```bash
npx degit ben-rogerson/craft-storybook-starter craft-storybook && cd $_ && npm install
```

Start Storybook with:
```bash
npm run storybook
```

Start Craft CMS setup:
```bash
composer install && ./craft setup
```

### Bring into an existing project

Adding Storybook into your project is a quick process:

1. Grab the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/ben-rogerson/craft-storybook-starter.git
    ```
2. Copy these folders into your project:
    ```
    .storybook
    stories
    templates/components
    ```
3. Install the Storybook `devDependencies`:<br>
    ```bash
    npm i -D @babel/core @babel/preset-env @storybook/addon-a11y @storybook/addon-knobs @storybook/addon-viewport @storybook/html faker babel-loader css-loader node-sass sass-loader style-loader twig twigjs-loader babel-plugin-module-resolver webpack-cli
    ```
4. Add these script definitions into your `package.json`:
    ```js
    "scripts": {
        "storybook": "start-storybook",
        "build-storybook": "build-storybook -c .storybook -o build"
    },
    ```
5. Start Storybook with: `npm run storybook`

## Working with Storybook

1. Create a normal Twig file somewhere in your templates folder:<br>
Eg: `/templates/components/[component].twig`
2. Add a matching story in the stories folder:<br>
Eg: `/stories/[component].stories.js`
3. Start Storybook with: `npm run storybook`

## Hosting your Storybook

Storybook builds static file previews for your components. This means you can leverage easy (and free) hosting services like Netlify.

Configure it to run `npm run build-storybook` and serve from the `/build` folder.

You could also use [Github pages](https://github.com/storybooks/storybook-deployer) to host your storybook.

## A heads up: Storybook Twig != Craft Twig

Storybook uses a JavaScript implementation of Twig and you may come across some of its limitations.

- Any Craft or Craft Plugin functions, or Twig tags or filters will throw an error
- [String interpolation](https://twig.symfony.com/doc/2.x/templates.html#string-interpolation) isn‚Äôt supported
- ~~Importing components within components isn't supported (perhaps fixable with Webpack adjustments)~~<br>Importing now works correctly

While I agree that this isn‚Äôt ideal, there is an upside to it. It forces small and basic components.
You see this same technique constantly in modern JavaScript apps and it‚Äôs a good thing! It‚Äôs a technique you can also bring to many of your Craft Components. If you‚Äôre interested in the concept check out [Atomic design](http://bradfrost.com/blog/post/atomic-web-design/).

If you‚Äôre bringing components into Storybook and you‚Äôre having compatibility issues you may need to break it up into a presentational and logic component. The presentational component would have the basic component html and wouldn‚Äôt contain the incompatible Twig code. This would be the component you‚Äôd display in Storybook.
